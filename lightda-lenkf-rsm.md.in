This is a local ensemble Kalman filter implementation, based heavily on the implementation from [PDAF](http://pdaf.awi.de/trac/wiki), but adapted for use with LightDA.

## Compiling

The simplest way to build the lenkf-rsm component is using the superbuild, which downloads and compiles LightDA and its dependencies compiling the lenkf-rsm component. It is invoked using CMake as follows:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../superbuild
make
```
